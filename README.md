# web_service_design_style_demo

The demo project talks about the three primary API styles used by web services. The importance of selecting the right API style cannot be underestimated. The API styles could vary in interoperability, speed, flexibility, and the level of synchronization of the service. Also, it becomes very hard to change direction once a style is chosen.

1. RPC style
2. Message style
3. Resource style

The project provides a demo of the same set of blockchain APIs based on the three styles.
